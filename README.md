# Explorer Challenge

This repository contains the codes that were used to solve the third exercise on Rocketseat's Explorer (FullStack) developer track. More information on Explorer's course can be found [here](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/formacao/fullstack).

This exercise refers to the module 02 - Advancing in HTML and CSS and is the first mandatory exercise.

## The challenge

This challenge consists in creating a HTML page with a form. The layout for the page should look something like the image below.

## The solution

To ensure that the challenge was done correctly, the first commit to this repository contains the basic code structure, being only a simple `index.html` and `sytle.css` files, with little to no content. The following commits add my progress on the development adding this `README.md` file, and each new feature to the code. I've tried to keep the commits as much atomic as possible, so that it is easier to follow each addition, trying to make each commit add a small part of the resolution.
